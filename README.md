# AEGIS Framework

**Architecture Européenne de Gouvernance des IA Systémiques**
Version 1.0 — 2026

Open Method for Sovereign, Auditable and AI Act-Aligned Engineering

---

## Overview

AEGIS Framework is an open engineering methodology designed to structure the development of AI systems as regulated, auditable and sovereign infrastructures from inception.

It provides a reproducible architectural approach to:

* qualify regulatory risk before development
* document technical decisions continuously
* govern open-source dependencies
* ensure proportional explainability
* preserve reversibility and technological sovereignty

AEGIS is not a compliance checklist.
It is a systemic engineering doctrine.

---

## Context

Artificial Intelligence is transitioning from experimental tooling to infrastructure-grade deployment.

In sensitive domains such as:

* robotics
* healthcare
* cognitive assistance
* public environments
* decision-support systems

compliance cannot be retrofitted. It must be designed.

AEGIS aligns with the European regulatory framework, including the AI Act, and promotes a design-first approach to responsible AI engineering.

---

## Core Principles

AEGIS is structured around five foundational principles:

1. **Ex-ante Risk Qualification**
   Regulatory classification precedes implementation.

2. **Continuous Documentation**
   Architectural decisions are traceable and versioned.

3. **Open-Source Governance**
   Dependencies are inventoried, licensed, and monitored.

4. **Proportional Explainability**
   System transparency matches context and risk level.

5. **Reversibility & Sovereignty**
   Architectures avoid structural dependency on proprietary APIs.

---

## Architectural Structure

The framework is organized into six operational layers:

1. Context Mapping
2. Regulatory Classification
3. Governed Technical Design
4. Open Dependency Governance
5. Living Compliance Documentation
6. Auditability & Reversibility Controls

Each layer is designed to integrate into real engineering workflows without blocking iteration or innovation.

---

## Intended Audience

AEGIS is intended for:

* AI system architects
* deep tech founders
* robotics engineers
* compliance officers
* public sector innovation teams
* European digital infrastructure initiatives

It is particularly relevant for projects operating in regulated or high-impact environments.

## License

AEGIS Framework is released under the GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3).

You are free to:

* use
* study
* modify
* redistribute

Under the condition that derivative work remains under GPLv3.

The intent is to preserve methodological openness while preventing proprietary enclosure.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome under the following conditions:

* architectural clarity
* regulatory coherence
* documented rationale for changes

This project values structural rigor over volume of contributions.

---

## Positioning

AEGIS does not compete with innovation speed.

It reframes compliance as architectural discipline.

Responsible AI is not achieved through correction.
It is achieved through design.
